# RECOVER
A cloud data pipeline for processing data from the RECOVER project. Please see our [project page](https://sagebionetworks.jira.com/wiki/spaces/IBC/pages/2808053761/RECOVER+ETL) for more information.

# Communication

Bug reports and feature requests or general feedback and questions can be made more or less formally. The less formal method is by posting in the [#recover](https://sagebionetworks.slack.com/archives/C04JMKK0543) Slack channel (available to employees of Sage Bionetworks). You may also create a more palpable paper trail by utilizing our [Jira service desk](https://sagebionetworks.jira.com/servicedesk/customer/portal/5/group/7), which is available to the public. All of our work is tracked on Jira and filing an issue within this GitHub repository risks your request getting lost. In either case (Slack or Jira), providing enough details for the developers to verify and troubleshoot your issue is appreciated!

If you are a DPE team member, feel free to post in the above Slack channel or create a ticket in the [ETL Jira project](https://sagebionetworks.jira.com/jira/software/c/projects/ETL/boards/190) directly.
