# Snowflake

We use Snowflake to interact with RECOVER data. Snowflake is a [DBMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database) with managed infrastructure that enables us to work with the data in a way that's easier and faster compared to AWS Glue. For general information about Snowflake, see Snowflake's [Key Concepts and Architecture](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/intro-key-concepts).

## Deployment
We deploy Snowflake objects as part of our CI/CD process. When a commit is pushed to a branch, all objects under the `objects` folder are deployed automatically to a database prefixed with the branch name, e.g., `RECOVER_MY_BRANCH_NAME`. Deployment happens within its own isolated environment, ensuring that deployments do not interfere with each other and maintain their own independent configurations and resources. An environment is analogous to a database. That said, account-level objects are reeused by each deployment. For more information, see [our deployment entrypoint](objects/deploy.sql).

### Deployment logic and object definitions
Deployment logic and object [DDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_definition_language) is organized as a hierarchy:
```
snowflake/objects
└── database
    └── recover
        └── schema
            └── parquet
                ├── file_format
                ├── stage
                └── table
```

Every level in this hierarchy has a `deploy.sql` which will deploy all child objects with respect to the current directory.
```
snowflake/objects
├── database
│   ├── deploy.sql
│   └── recover
│       ├── deploy.sql
│       └── schema
│           ├── deploy.sql
│           └── parquet
│               ├── deploy.sql
│               ├── file_format
│               │   ├── deploy.sql
│               │   └── parquet_format.sql
│               ├── stage
│               │   ├── deploy.sql
│               │   └── parquet_s3.sql
│               └── table
│                   ├── deploy.sql
│                   ├── enrolledparticipants_customfields_symptoms_parquet.sql
│                   ├── enrolledparticipants_customfields_treatments_parquet.sql
│                   ├── enrolledparticipants_parquet.sql
│                   ├── fitbitactivitylogs_parquet.sql
│                   ├── fitbitdailydata_parquet.sql
│                   ├── ...
└── deploy.sql
```
For example, the file located at `snowflake/objects/database/recover/deploy.sql` will deploy all objects under the `RECOVER` database, and `snowflake/objects/database/recover/schema/parquet/deploy.sql` will deploy the file formats, stages, and tables under the `PARQUET` schema.

The child objects, that is, the schemas, file formats, stages, tables – anything that is not a database – are defined in such a way as to be agnostic to their parent context. For example, `snowflake/objects/database/recover/schema/parquet/deploy.sql` will deploy the `PARQUET` schema and all its child objects to whichever database your Snowflake user assumes. There is nothing in the SQL which restricts the `PARQUET` schema to be created within the `RECOVER` database. Likewise, the tables in `snowflake/objects/database/recover/schema/parquet/table/` can be deployed to any schema, although their DDL is specific to the columns in our Parquet datasets.
